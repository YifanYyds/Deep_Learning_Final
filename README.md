# Comparing LSTM and Simple RNN for Sentiment Analysis
## Introduction
In this project, we explore the performance differences between Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Simple Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in the context of sentiment analysis. Utilizing TensorFlow Keras, we implement and compare these models to understand their strengths and limitations in handling sequential data. Our focus is on evaluating their accuracy and training efficiency, providing insights into their applicability for various tasks in deep learning.
## Dataset
This project utilizes a publicly available dataset for multiclass sentiment analysis, which can be accessed [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Sp1786/multiclass-sentiment-analysis-dataset).
 The dataset is pre-divided into training, validation, and test sets, simplifying the data preparation process. It consists of textual data classified into three sentiment categories: negative, neutral, and positive, represented numerically as 0, 1, and 2, respectively. This rich dataset provides a realistic scenario for evaluating the comparative effectiveness of LSTM and Simple RNN models in classifying sentiments with varying degrees of complexity.
